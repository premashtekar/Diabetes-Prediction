# Diabetes Prediction System

- Machine learning–based system to predict the probability of diabetes in patients  
- Uses Logistic Regression with standardized numeric features  
- Handles missing values and categorical data using one-hot encoding  
- Trained on Kaggle Playground Series diabetes dataset  
- Evaluation metric used: ROC–AUC  
- Interactive web interface built using Streamlit  
- Supports manual patient data entry for real-time prediction  
- Allows bulk prediction through CSV file upload  
- Generates probability-based outputs suitable for Kaggle submission  
- Model is saved as `model.pkl` for reuse without retraining  
- Designed for academic submission and beginner-friendly ML practice
